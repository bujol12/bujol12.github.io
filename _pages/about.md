I'm an MPhil student at the Computer Lab (formally known as the Department of Computer Science and Technology), at the University of Cambridge. I am supervised by [Dr Challenger Mishra](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/cm2099) and [Prof Pietro Li√≤](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/). My recent interests revolve around Symmetries and Equivariant Neural Networks. Throughout my degree, I have had a chance to explore multiple areas of research, such as Topological Deep Learning or Mechanistic Interpretability.

Previously, I completed a BEng degree in Joint Maths & Computer Science at Imperial College London, where I was supervised by [Dr Marek Rei](https://www.marekrei.com/) and worked on building unsupervised rationale extractors for transformer-based sentence and document classifiers.

I have also had a chance to work and intern at some amazing companies. Before and during my undergraduate degree, I was a Data Scientist at [GOGOX](https://www.gogox.com/), a logistics startup based in Hong Kong. Over there, I worked on making a data-driven automated decision making by working on [Route Optimisation](https://towardsdatascience.com/improving-operations-with-route-optimization-4b8a3701ca39), [Demand Prediction](https://medium.com/gogox-technology/moving-the-needle-predicting-unmet-demand-in-on-demand-ecosystems-d30174a6ccff), [Real-time Analytics and Machine Learning](https://medium.com/gogox-technology/get-real-transitioning-to-real-time-marketplace-analytics-with-ops-data-brain-535f81582dfd) and scalable ML deployment. I have also interned at [Bloomberg LP](https://www.bloomberg.com) and [Jump Trading](https://jumptrading.com/), focussing on writing scalable and fast modern C++ code.
